\subsection {LSST Tucson}\label{sect:tucson}
LSST in Tucson hosts he LSST project and for DM it hosts  the DM project manager (\secref{role:dmpm}) and the DM System Engineer (\secref{role:sysengineer}). The largest group for DM in Tucson is SQuaRE described below. 

\subsubsection{DM Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) Leads \label{sect:square}}
The DM SQuaRE Leads are the SQuaRE Lead Scientist and the SQuaRE Technical Manager.  The primary organisational responsibility for this Tucson-led group is to provide scientific and technical feedback to the LSST DM Manager that demonstrates LSST/AURA DM is fulfilling its responsibilities as charged by the NSF with regards to quality and software performance and reliability.
They are responsible for monitoring the reliability and maintainability of software developed by DM and the quality of the data products produced by the DM software in production. SQuaRE's activities span processes and environments for software development, integration test and distribution.  SQuaRE also assumes responsibility for delivering any work in this area, though in many cases this may involve effort across the DM team.
As such, areas of activity include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of algorithms to detect and analyse quality issues with data
	\item Infrastructure development to support the generation, collection, and analysis of data quality and performance metrics
	\item DM developer support services to ensure DM is using appropriate tools to aid software quality
	\item Support of publicly released software products, including porting and distributing it according to the scientific community?s needs.
\end{itemize}

In the event that SQuaRE identifies issues with the performance or future maintainability of the DM codebase, it brings them to the attention of the DM System Architect, who is ultimately responsible to decide who will address them and how. In the event that SQuaRE identifies issues with the quality of the data, it brings them to the attention of the DM Project Scientist.
