\section{Lead institutions in DM \label{sect:leadtutes}}

\subsection{LSST Tucson\label{sect:tucson}}

The LSST Project Office in Tucson hosts the DM Project Manager (\secref{role:dmpm}) and the Systems Engineer (\secref{role:sysengineer}).
In addition, it is home to the Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) group, described below.

\subsubsection{Science Quality and Reliability Engineering \label{sect:square}}

The SQuaRE group is primarily charged with providing technical feedback to the DM Project Manager that demonstrates that DM is fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to quality — of both scientific data products and software — software performance, and reliability. As such, areas of activity include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Development of algorithms to detect and analyze quality issues with data\footnote{This may overlap with work carried out by the Science Pipelines groups (\S\S\ref{sect:ap} \& \ref{sect:drp}). In some instances this will involve sharing code; in others, it may merit duplicating a metric to ensure that it is correct.}

\item Infrastructure development to support the generation, collection, and analysis of data quality and performance metrics

\item DM developer support services to ensure DM is using appropriate tools to aid software quality

\item DM documentation support, to include defining standards and providing tooling for documentation as well as some document writing

\item Support of publicly released software products, including porting and distributing it according to the scientific community's needs

\end{itemize}

In the event that SQuaRE identifies issues with the performance or future maintainability of the DM codebase, it will bring them to the attention of the DM Software Architect. In the event that SQuaRE identifies issues with the quality of the data or algorithmic performance, it will bring them to the attention of the DM Project Scientist.

\subsection {Princeton University \label{sect:princeton}}

Princeton University hosts the Pipelines Scientist (\secref{role:pipe}) and the Data Release Production group, described below.

\subsubsection{Data Release Production \label{sect:drp}}

The Data Release Production (DRP) group has three major areas of activity within DM.

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Definition and implementation of the scientific algorithms and pipelines which will be used to generated LSST's annual data releases;}

  \item{Definition and implementation of the algorithms and pipelines which will be used to produce the ``calibration products'' (for example, flat fields, characterization of detector effects, etc) which will be used as inputs to the photometric calibration procedure in both nightly and annual data processing. This includes the development of the spectrophotometric data reduction pipeline for the Auxiliary Telescope;}

  \item{Development, in conjunction with the Alert Production team (AP; \secref{sect:ap}), of a library of re-usable software libraries and components which form the basis of both the AP and DRP pipelines and which are made available to science users within the LSST Science Platform.}

\end{itemize}

Development of software in support of annual data releases and of reusable software components are carried out under the direction of the DRP Science Lead, who acts as product owner for this part of the system.
The DRP Science Lead is ultimately responsible to both the Pipelines Scientist (\secref{role:pipe}) and DM Project Scientist (\secref{role:dmps}).

The product owner for calibration products product is the LSST Calibration Scientist (who doubles as the Pipelines Scientist, \secref{role:pipe}).
The Calibration Scientist liases with other LSST subsystems and with the products owners of the annual and nightly data processing pipelines to ensure that appropriate calibration products are available to those pipelines to enable them to meet specifications.

Management of the group is the responsibility of the Science Pipelines T/CAM, reporting to the DM Project Manager (\secref{role:dmpm}).

The DRP group is responsible for delivering software which adheres to the architectural and testing standard defined by the Software Architect (\secref{role:softarc}).
In addition, the DRP group is responsible for testing each major product delivered to demonstrate its fitness for purpose, and working with the DM Project Scientist and DM System Science Team (\secref{sect:dmsst}) to define, run and analyze ``data challenges'' and other large scale tests to validate the performance of the data release production system.

\subsection {The University of Washington\label{sect:uw}}

\subsubsection{Alert Production\label{sect:ap}}

\subsection {California Institute of Technology/IPAC\label{sect:ipac}}

\subsection {SLAC\label{sect:slac}}
SLAC hosts the DM Software Architect (\secref{role:softarc}) and the Science Data Archive and Data Access
Services group described below.

\subsubsection{Science Data Archive and Data Access Services \label{sect:dax}}

The Science Data Archive and Data Access Services (DAX) group has the following major areas of activity
within DM:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Provides software to support ingestion, indexing, query, and administration of DM catalog and image
  data products, data provenance, and other associated metadata within the LSST Data Access Centers;}

  \item{Provides implementations of data access services (including IVOA services), as well as associated
  client libraries, to be hosted within the LSST Data Access Centers, which facilitate interaction between
  LSST data products and tools provided by both other parts of the LSST project and by the astronomical
  research community at large;}

  \item{Provides a Python framework (the "Data Butler"), used by the LSST science pipelines, to facilitate
  abstract persistence/retrieval of in-memory Python objects to/from generic archives of those objects;}

  \item{Provides a Python framework ("SuperTask") which serves as an interface layer between pipeline
  orchestration and algorithmic code, and which allows pipelines to be constructed, configured, and run at
  the level of a single node or a group of tightly-synchronized nodes;}

  \item{Provides support for various middleware and infrastructure toolkits used by DM which would otherwise
  have no authoritative home institution within DM (e.g. logging support library, spherical geometry support
  library).}

\end{itemize}

Management of the group is the responsibility of the DAX T/CAM, reporting to the DM Project Manager
(\secref{role:dmpm}).

The DAX group is responsible for delivering software which adheres to the architectural and testing standard
defined by the Software Architect (\secref{role:softarc}). In addition, the DAX group is responsible for
testing each major product delivered to demonstrate its fitness for purpose, and running and analyzing large
scale tests to validate the performance of the science data archive and data access systems.
