\subsubsection*{1.02C.05.00: Management, Leadership, \& Other Costs}

This WBS element covers Project Management, Control Account Management, and
Scientific Leadership of the Science User Interface and Tools group. It
includes effort to develop the overall schedule and cost for the work, perform
day-to-day technical management of the team, coordinate with other parts of
the WBS, provide support for invoices, and contribute to the operation of the DM
Subsystem Science Team. It also includes effort from all team members which
does not directly contribute to a specific deliverable (for example,
attendance at team meetings).
