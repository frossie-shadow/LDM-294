\paragraph*{1.02C.06.02.03: Query Services}

This WBS element includes work needed to come up with a DBMS that meets LSST user query analysis needs. Such DBMS should include standard off-the-shelf DBMS capabilities including advanced features such as scalability to petabytes, incremental scaling, parallel queries, shared scans, fault tolerance, resource management, as well as LSST-specific features such as efficient support for spatial and temporal data at scale.

The work involves customizing, optimizing, improving and gluing together relevant components, building missing features, configuration files, unit tests, integration tests, and documentation. It also includes building tools for maintaining, configuring, and administering such system.
