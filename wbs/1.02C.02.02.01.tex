\paragraph*{1.02C.02.02.01: System Architecture Definition}

This WBS element includes all activities related to documenting the high-level
architecture of the LSST Data Management System.  This includes writing and
maintaining documents that define and describe the DMS's high-level components
and their interfaces, both internal and external, as well as how they work
together and are operated to meet the DM System Requirements.  This work is
performed in conjunction with the technical leadership of the DM teams as well
as that of other LSST subsystems.
