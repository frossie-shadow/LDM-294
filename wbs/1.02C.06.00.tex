\subsubsection*{1.02C.06.00: Management, Leadership, \& Other Costs}

This WBS element covers Project Management, Control Account Management, and
technical leadership of the Science Data Archive and Data Access Services
group. It includes effort to develop the overall schedule and cost for the
work, perform day-to-day technical management of the team, coordinate with
other parts of the WBS, and provide support for invoices. It also includes
effort from all team members which does not directly contribute to a specific
deliverable (for example, attendance at team meetings).
