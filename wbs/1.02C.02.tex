\subsection*{1.02C.02: Systems Engineering}

\begin{note}
Review this in conjunction with Wil, Mario \& KTL: some uncertainty as to
whether Arch and Science are both sub-elements of SysEng.
\end{note}

This WBS element includes all systems engineering activities for the LSST Data
Management subsystem, including all subsystem level modeling and simulation
development as well as subsystem and system level technical reviews of
deliverables.
