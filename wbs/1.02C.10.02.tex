\subsubsection{1.02C.10.02: Quality Control, Dataspace Services, and Developer Infrastructure}

This WBS element consists of software, services, unit tests, integration tests, configuration and deployment automation, availability monitoring and documentation for: quality analysis, enabling of science analysis, automated quality control, verification and developer services.

\paragraph{02C.10.2.1: Automated Software and Science Quality Control Service}

This WBS element consists of software and services that support the
implementation of Data Management's plan to ensure the quality of the DM
Pipelines.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  10.2.1.01 SQuaSH: A harness for executing prepared tests automatically
  and continuously to characterise the algorithmic performance of the
  code, key aspects of the performance of the facility that are apparent
  in the data, its verification status, and uncover regressions to aid
  development.
\item
  10.2.1.02 Monitoring: A system for notifying when values for 10.2.1.01
  metrics exceed notifiable limits.
\item
  10.2.1.03 Verification Reports Tooling: Using data produced by
  10.2.1.01 to create verification reports and software release
  characterisations.
\item
  10.2.1.04 Harness to perform QA tests on the alert stream

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{02C.10.2.2 Science Platform Notebook Environment for QA,  Commissioning \& User Science}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  10.2.2.01 Jupyter Notebook \& Templates: A set of notebooks, and
  templates for making them, that demonstrate key features of the
  capabilities of the system. 
\item
  10.2.2.02 JupyterLab deployment: Architecture, orchestration and deployment configuration for the Sciene Platform Notebook service for commissioning.
  \item
  10.2.2.03 Custom Portals/Notebooks: The SUI team is providing a
  portal framework as part of the 02C.05 WBS. This WBS covers
  supporting these portals post-delivery where they relate to QA and
  comissioning activities as necessary.
\item
  10.2.2.04 Notebook software environments: Production of environments
  (eg. containers) suitable for the execution of 10.2.2.01
\item
  10.2.2.05 Notebook execution: The process to scale notebook execution
  from 10.4.1 so they can execute over a large dataset. This involves an interface to the batch workflow system.
\item
  10.2.2.06 Dataspace packaging: The packaging and configuration
  required to deploy the dataspace on a platform that is design-matched
  to the compute and filespace elements of the Archive Center dataspace
  (eg. if the DAC compute is based on an openstack architecture, the
  deliverable of this WBS are the packages, configuration, automation
  deployment and instructions that would allow a Data Access Center at
  an international partner to deploy a Dataspace service on top of their
  open OpenStack compute for their own users.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{02C10.2.3 Developer Infrastructure, Software Distribution, Documentation Tooling, Communication Tooling}

This WBS element consists of services that support a large distributed
software team and its product. It includes systems that support current
best practices in software engineering such as continuous integration,
release management, software packaging and distribution, documentation
standards, and infrastructure and communication tooling supporting
development and team culture. All these services are oriented towards
developers, and some are also oriented towards users of the DM software
outside DM. While these are EVM deliverables, work is planned in such a
way to reserve effort for ad-hoc developer-driven requests, since these
are customer-oriented services that benefit from continuous improvement.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  10.2.3.01 Software Development Services: Continuous Integration
  service(s), repository management, code linters, software development
  environments.
\item
  10.2.3.02 Release Engineering: Release management, portability
  testing, binary and containerized distribution, build tooling.
\item
  10.2.3.03 Documentation Tooling: Documentation standards,
  documentation linters, software and technical documentation production
  and publication, developer guide, user guide, tutorials, document
  discover services.
\item
  10.2.3.04 Communication Tooling: Community forum, ChatOps
\item
  10.2.3.05 Bug/Tracking Helpdesk: Bug Tracking, Helpdesk, Community
  Management
\end{itemize}
