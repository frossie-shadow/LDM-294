\subsubsection{1.02C.03.07: Photometric calibration on stacks}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with
its associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which
will allow for high precision photometric calibration of objects using
multiple apperitions of each object.  This will allow for full focalplane
photometric calibration.  This will support photometric zeropoints which
vary on scales smaller than a chip.
