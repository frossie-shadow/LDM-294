\subsubsection*{1.02C.05.08: Applications}
\label{wbs:1.02C.05.08}

This WBS element covers the construction of the Portal Aspect of the LSST Science Platform software, including online help, deployment instructions, and other documents. The Portal uses the core Firefly components and the LSST-specific software interfaces in \hyperref[wbs:1.02C.05.07]{1.02C.05.07}, relying on infrastructure and data access services provided under other WBS elements, to deliver a portal for the science community to access, discover, explore, analyze, and download the LSST data. It covers the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item{The overall user interface layout and structure;}
\item{Basic access to all LSST catalog and image data (Level 1, Level 2, user/Level 3, calibration, and Engineering and Facilities Database);}
\item{Scientifically motivated workflows guiding users to the available data and illuminating connections among tables and between tables and images;}
\item{All-sky displays allowing exploration of the image data and of maps of the properties of the LSST survey across the sky;}
\item{Access to the user workspace, supporting data sharing and and collaboration;}
\item{Deployment packaging and configuration management.}

\end{itemize}
