\subsubsection{1.02C.08.03: Long Haul Networks}

The LSST high-speed network plan consists of two principle segments and
several sub-segments:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Chilean National WAN

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{La Serena--Santiago (principal and secondary paths)}
      \item{La Serena--AURA Gatehouse}
      \item{AURA Gatehouse--Summits}
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \item{International Chile--US WAN

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Santiago--U.S (100 Gbps Ring)}
      \item{Santiago--US (Spectrum)}
      \item{US National}
    \end{itemize}
  }
\end{enumerate}

Implementation of these two primary segments were assigned to REUNA (Chilean)
and FIU/AmLight (International). Subsequently, it was determined that the AURA
Gatehouse--Summits subsement would be a direct contract from AURA to
Telefonica for installation, and operated by AURA/REUNA.

The Chilean network implementation involves the execution of five separate
contracts. These contracts are embedded in the Work Breakdown Structure and
details are provided for each one\footnote{Contractual details have been
elided from the summary in this document.}.

Similarly, the International network implementation involves the execution of
four separate contracts. These contracts are embedded in the Work Breakdown
Structure, and details are provided for each one\footnote{Ditto.}.
