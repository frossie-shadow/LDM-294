\subsection*{1.02C.03: Alert Production}

This WBS element covers three broad areas of work:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{The development of scientific algorithms and pipelines which will be
  used to process the LSST image stream to identify transients, variables and
  moving objects;}

  \item{The rapid production and dissemination of alerts describing
  sources detected by LSST in the difference image;}

  \item{The development of a system for identifying moving solar system
  objects and fitting their physical properties;}

  \item{The development of reusable algorithmic and software primitives which
  will be used in the construction of both nightly and annual data processing
  pipelines.}

\end{itemize}
