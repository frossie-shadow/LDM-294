\subsubsection*{1.02C.05.07: LSST Science Platform Interfaces}
\label{wbs:1.02C.05.07}

This WBS element covers the construction of software components that provide the connection between the core data search/visualization components and the rest of the ``LSST Science Platform'': supporting the LSST data model, data-access services, and compute and storage resource access. It includes the development of associated documentation and test suites.

It incorporates the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item{Interface to LSST-specific user identity and management services;}
\item{Access to LSST user workspace;}
\item{Search processors matching the DAX interfaces;}
\item{Search processors for the Engineering and Facilities Database;}
\item{Interface for invoking LSST stack Python code to perform services needed by the Portal;}
\item{Support for reading and displaying LSST-specific data formats (such as afw.table-format files) and data objects (e.g., masks, Footprints, PSF models);}
\item{Support for the afw.display interface to Firefly.}
\end{itemize}
