\subsubsection*{1.02C.07.06.02: Reusable Production Services}

This element of the WBS contains the work to instantiate and run project-oriented production services that are reused to support many development, integration and production use cases.
These services understand the operational relationships of the service dependencies and components and are aware of representative use cases of the service.

The work includes integration of all service components, readiness testing, service-level documentation, integration into service management and service monitoring systems, integration with security controls, configurations of components and integration with reliant services, deployment into production, early life support, and operation for construction and commissioning user cases (including management, configuration, upgrading, monitoring, request response, problem management, and first-order quality assurance of scientific and technical aspects of production services).
