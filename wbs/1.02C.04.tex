\subsection*{1.02C.04: Data Release Production}

This WBS element covers three broad areas of work:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{The development of scientific algorithms and pipelines which will be
  used to generate LSST's annual data releases;}

  \item{The development of algorithms and pipelines which will be used to
  generate the calibration products requried in both nightly and annual data
  processing;}

  \item{The development of reusable algorithmic and software primitives which
  will be used in the construction of both nightly and annual data processing
  pipelines.}

\end{itemize}
