\subsubsection*{1.02C.05.06: Client-server Query \& Visualization Framework}
This WBS element covers the construction of low-level, re-usable software components which form the core libraries (Firefly) underlying both the client and server sides of the LSST Science User Interface Portal. It includes software packaging, releases, and deployment, the production of test suites demonstrating the correct operation of the components, and the development of technical, developer-focused documentation describing their use.

Firefly comprises a variety of capabilities, including the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item{Libraries for data display and visualization for tabular data and astronomical images, including various 2D charts, and a shared data model supporting data overlays on images, and brushing and linking among related displays;}
\item{Abstract search processor interface;}
\item{Libraries for data query, retrieval, and export, including an abstract search processor interface as well as implementations providing common astronomical archive search forms and interfaces to standard (including VO) data query APIs;}

\item{Support for various common formats for astronomical tabular and image data;}
\item{JavaScript and low-level Python APIs, used internally as well as providing for user control and customization;}
\item{Identity and preferences management;}
\item{Load balancing.}

\end{itemize}
