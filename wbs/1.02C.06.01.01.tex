\paragraph{1.02C.06.01.01: Database Catalogs, Alerts, and Metadata}

This WBS element includes software programs, database tables, configuration files, unit tests, component integration tests, and documentation that implement Database Catalogs, Alerts, and Metadata capabilities.

It implements all database catalogs: L1 Alert Production and User Database, L2 Internal DRP, L2 Data Release Catalogs, Level 3 Catalogs, Calibration Database, Restructured Engineering Facilities Database, and Deep Drilling Database. It includes schemas and structures (partitioning, replication, distribution models, L1 production/user, L2 swap/release), and tools for manipulating the catalogs, such as managing ingest, replication, hot swap, recovery and import/export.
 
It implements data-product-specific metadata and provenance for all LSST data product catalogs and images. It includes schemas and structures (partitioning, replication, distribution models), and tools for manipulating the metadata, such as managing ingest, replication, hot swap, recovery and import/export. Global metadata that spans multiple data products is handled through 02C.06.02.05.
 
It implements structure for alerts, as well as tools for persisting and efficiently retrieving them.
