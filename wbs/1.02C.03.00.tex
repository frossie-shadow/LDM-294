\subsubsection*{1.02C.03.00: Management, Leadership \& Other Costs}

This WBS element covers project management and scientific leadership of the
Alert Production group. It includes effort to develop the overall plan for the
work of the group, to schedule that work, to perform day-to-day technical and
control account management of the team, to coordinate development with other
parts of the LSST WBS, and to contribute to the operation of the DM Subsystem
Science Team. It also includes effort from all team members which does not
directly contribute to a specific deliverable (for example, attendance at team
meetings).
