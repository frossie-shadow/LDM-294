\subsubsection{1.02C.03.08: Astrometric calibration on a stack}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with
its associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which
will allow for high precision astrometric calibration of objects using
multiple apparitions of each object.  This will support fitting composeable
astrometric models that can represent distortions on a variety of scales
from multiple different sources.  This will allow the distortions fromt he
optical system to be separated from the distortions imprinted by the atmosphere.
