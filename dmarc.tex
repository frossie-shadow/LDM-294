\section{Data Management Conceptual Architecture} \label{sect:dmarc}

The DM architecture is detail in \citeds{LDM-148} - a few of the higher level diagrams are reproduced here to 
orientate the reader in DM.

In operations components of DM are installed and running in several locations. Namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item Commissioning cluster (which may be physically in NCSA)
\item The main centre, NCSA enclave in Champaign Urbana
\item The US Data Access Centre(DAC) also at NCSA in Champaign Urbana
\item The Chilean DAC in the Base Facility in La Serena Chile. 
\item The Satellite Processing Centre at IN2P3 in Lyons, France.
\end{itemize}
\figref{fig:dmsdeploy} shows these physical compute environments  and the DM components which are deployed there. 
 Some components are dotted and split across different
environments; the connections between these are labelled with the
protocols involved.  Science payloads (productions) are in shown in blue.
The Science Platform is expanded in \figref{fig:sciplat}, likewise the data backbone is 
a complex piece of infrastructure and is expanded in \figref{fig:databb}.

showing where Qserv and the Butler fit
into the system as well as metadata and provenance.

The common infrastructure services layer is underlying the compute environments. 
This does not list  specific technologies for management/monitoring,
provisioning/deployment, or workload/workflow, but you can think of them
as things like Nagios, Puppet/vSphere/OpenStack/Kubernetes, and Pegasus.

\subsection{External Interfaces}
The DM interfaces are {\bf Gregory or KT ??}
\subsubsection{Auxiliary data in DM}
Certain tasks in DM rely on external catalogues and other information. Currently we believe we need:
\begin{enumerate}
		        \item Gaia catalogue (Release 2) as a photometry baseline.
		\end{enumerate}
