\section{Development Process} \label{sect:devproc}

DM is essentially a large software project, more we are developing scientific software with the in uncertainties that brings with it. 
An agile \citep{it:agile} is particularly suited to scientific software development.  The development follows a six month  cyclical approach and  DM  products are under continuous
integration using the application software Jenkins. All code is developed in the GitHub open source repository under an open source license.

How this fits with the Earned Value System is described in \citeds{DMTN-020}.

\subsection{Reviews} \label{sect:reviews}
We expect DM level reviews from NSF/DOE. In addition internally we should review major components such as :
\begin{itemize}

\item  Science and Alerts Pipelines Review 
\item   QA Plan Review 
  \item  Science platform, perhaps in 3 parts
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item  JupyterLab 
	  \item SUI portal
	  \item Web/APIs
	\end{itemize}
  \item  Calibration Review 

\end{itemize}
